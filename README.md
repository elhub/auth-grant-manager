* Facilitate the collection of explicit consent from users for a variety of business and data processing activities.
* Provide a centralized repository for storing and managing user consent preferences.
* Enable granular control over consent settings, allowing users to specify their preferences for different types of
  data processing activities.
* Ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and standards related to data privacy and consent management.
